    "text": "This document demonstrates the use of a number of advanced page layout features to produce an attractive and usable document inspired by the Tufte handout style and the use of Tufte’s styles in RMarkdown documents. The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto1 supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.1 To learn more, you can read more about Quarto or visit Quarto’s Github repository.\n---\ntitle: \"An Example Using the Tufte Style\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n1      margin-width: 350px\n  pdf: default\n2reference-location: margin\ncitation-location: margin\n---\n\n1\n\nIncreases the width of the margin to make more room for sidenotes and margin figures (HTML only).\n\n2\n\nPlaces footnotes and cited sources in the margin. Other layout options (for example placing a figure in the margin) will be set per element in examples below.\n\n\nThese layout features are designed with two important goals in mind:\n\nTo produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same Quarto document;\nTo provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures. If you’d like a figure placed in the margin, just set the option fig-column: margin for your code chunk, and we will take care of the details for you2.\n\n2 You never need to think about \\begin{marginfigure} or &lt;span class=\"marginfigure\"&gt;; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.If you have any feature requests or find bugs in these capabilities, please do not hesitate to file them to https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues."

    "text": "Missing Values\nFirst things first, read the full data description1. The manifest is available here. There you’ll find that for several columns missing values NA means actually “None”. The physical absence of a determined feature in a house is a category exposing the lack of such quality that can have a significant impact on the Sale Price (response).1 Tip: print a copy, make notes and study it. This is the first step to get into domain knowledge for Feature Engineering in the modelling phase.\nTherefore, I will fill the empty NA fields of the indicated columns of both datasets with the string “None”.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: easy replace_na\n\ncols_NA_to_none &lt;- list(\n  Alley = \"None\",\n  BsmtQual = \"None\", BsmtCond = \"None\", BsmtExposure = \"None\", BsmtFinType1 = \"None\", BsmtFinType2 = \"None\", \n  FireplaceQu = \"None\", \n  GarageType = \"None\", GarageFinish = \"None\", GarageQual = \"None\", GarageCond = \"None\", \n  PoolQC = \"None\",\n  Fence = \"None\", \n  MiscFeature = \"None\")\n\ndf_all &lt;- df_all |&gt;\n  replace_na(cols_NA_to_none) \n  \ndf_sub &lt;- df_sub |&gt;\n  replace_na(cols_NA_to_none)\n```\n\n\nOne of the early and recurrent steps of the EDA is to check the completeness of data. Let’s search for missing values, after filling indicated fields2. For this case I wrote the function count_na() that generates the tables displayed on the right margin.2 Tip: write a function to quantify missing values depending on the language and labelling system used.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: Counting NAs\n#| code-fold: false\n#| column: margin\n\ndf_all |&gt; \n  count_na() |&gt;  \n  knitr::kable(caption = 'Training dataset')\n\ndf_sub |&gt; \n  count_na() |&gt;  \n  knitr::kable(caption = 'Submission dataset')  \n```\n\n\n\nTraining dataset\n\n\nVariable\nNA_count\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nLotFrontage\n259\n17.74\n\n\nGarageYrBlt\n81\n5.55\n\n\nMasVnrType\n8\n0.55\n\n\nMasVnrArea\n8\n0.55\n\n\nElectrical\n1\n0.07\n\n\n\n\nSubmission dataset\n\n\nVariable\nNA_count\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nLotFrontage\n227\n15.56\n\n\nGarageYrBlt\n78\n5.35\n\n\nMasVnrType\n16\n1.10\n\n\nMasVnrArea\n15\n1.03\n\n\nMSZoning\n4\n0.27\n\n\nUtilities\n2\n0.14\n\n\nBsmtFullBath\n2\n0.14\n\n\nBsmtHalfBath\n2\n0.14\n\n\nFunctional\n2\n0.14\n\n\nExterior1st\n1\n0.07\n\n\nExterior2nd\n1\n0.07\n\n\nBsmtFinSF1\n1\n0.07\n\n\nBsmtFinSF2\n1\n0.07\n\n\nBsmtUnfSF\n1\n0.07\n\n\nTotalBsmtSF\n1\n0.07\n\n\nKitchenQual\n1\n0.07\n\n\nGarageCars\n1\n0.07\n\n\nGarageArea\n1\n0.07\n\n\nSaleType\n1\n0.07\n\n\n\n\nI will fill the remaining missing values as follow:\n\nThe LotFrontage column refers to the linear feet of street connected to the house. This feature is not well documented and the missing percentage related to other variables makes it unreliable, therefore, I will delete the feature.\nEverytime there is no garage, i.e., GarageType = \"None\", there is the corresponding missing value in Garage Year Built GarageYrBlt = NA. I will engineer a new feature called GarageNew with three ordinal categories: None, No, Yes. This based on the delta of YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt; I expect that given the house price, the algorithm will learn that “None” is worse than “No” and so on. Then I will remove the GarageYrBlt predictor.\nFor the rest of variables with a 1 % or less NA, I’ll calculate the median (if numerical) and the mode (if categorical) in order to fill them with it.\n\nHere’s my pipeline for both datasets:\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: terminating NAs\n\n# \"replace_na_with_median\" is a custom function\n\ndf_all &lt;- df_all |&gt;\n  mutate(LotFrontage = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = if_else(YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(GarageNew = \"None\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = factor(GarageNew, levels = c(\"None\", \"No\", \"Yes\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageYrBlt = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, replace_na_with_median)\n\ndf_sub &lt;- df_sub |&gt;\n  mutate(LotFrontage = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = if_else(YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(GarageNew = \"None\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = factor(GarageNew, levels = c(\"None\", \"No\", \"Yes\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageYrBlt = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, replace_na_with_median)\n```\n\n\nLet’s get a list with the mode of each remaining columns containing missing values NA.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: Mode for NAs\n\n# Get the mode for reamaining columns with NAs:\n\n# Good and old-fashion code: apply(df_all, 2, find_mode)\n\nls_na_mode_all &lt;- df_all |&gt;\n  select(MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, Electrical) |&gt;\n  map(find_mode)\n\nls_na_mode_sub &lt;- df_sub |&gt; \n  select(MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, MSZoning, Utilities,   BsmtFullBath,   BsmtHalfBath,   Functional, Exterior1st,    Exterior2nd,    BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF,  TotalBsmtSF,    KitchenQual,    GarageCars, GarageArea, SaleType) |&gt;\n  map(find_mode)\n\n# Replace with the created named-lists\ndf_all &lt;- df_all |&gt;\n  replace_na(ls_na_mode_all) \n  \ndf_sub &lt;- df_sub |&gt;\n  replace_na(ls_na_mode_sub)\n\n# Check for last time for missing values:\nprint(\"Training dataset\")\ndf_all |&gt;\n  count_na()\n\nprint(\"Submission dataset\")\ndf_sub |&gt;\n  count_na()\n```\n\n\n[1] \"Training dataset\"\n[1] \"No missing values (NA) found.\"\n[1] \"Submission dataset\"\n[1] \"No missing values (NA) found.\"\n\n\n“The data is complete!” Let’s think about predictors."

Think about the next modelling phase, where you want to reduce features, e.g., where new Principal Components are the new aggregators of original features.\nIn this part I will establish which variables are categorical and numerical; this is not always as obvious as it seems4.4 Tip: integer variables like calendar Years can be treated as categories for the analysis.\nThe first easy thing that comes to mind is to add the total area of the property as a new column named TotalAreaSF; SF means Squared Feet.\nAfter that, I check the data documentation to see which variables can be thought as categoricals (factors); this can be tedeous if Real Estate is not your domain of expertise.\nAfter 1.5 hours of reading, googling, understanding other notebooks and deliberating (yes, it was tedeous), I can summarise four types of ways to engineer new features depending on the nature of the variables:\n\nAggregation to a total of continous-numerical surface area (Square Feet), e.g. new TotalInteriorArea Feat. summing basement and floors, etc. Same for a new TotalExteriorArea. Then deleting the addends variables.\nAggregation to a total of numerical counts of an available installation of a determined type, e.g. new TotalBaths. Then deleting the addends.\nCategorisation with ascending quality levels of the originally numerical variables OverallQual and OverallCond.\nCreation of new binary features that state if a determined installation exists or doesn’t.\n\nHere’s the code that complies with the four previous steps:\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: Feature Engineering\n\n# --- Total Aggregations ----\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n\n  # Continuous numerical ----\n  # NEW TotalInteriorArea\n  mutate(TotalInteriorArea = BsmtFinSF1 + BsmtFinSF2 + `1stFlrSF` + `2ndFlrSF`) |&gt;\n  select(-c(BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, `1stFlrSF`))|&gt; # Bye bye...\n\n  # NEW TotalExteriorArea\n  mutate(TotalExteriorArea = WoodDeckSF + OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + `3SsnPorch` + ScreenPorch) |&gt;\n  select(-c(WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF, EnclosedPorch, `3SsnPorch`, ScreenPorch)) |&gt;# Bye bye...\n\n  # Counting numerical ----\n  # NEW TotalBaths\n  mutate(TotalBaths = BsmtFullBath + 0.5 * BsmtHalfBath + FullBath + 0.5 * HalfBath) |&gt; \n  select(-c(BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath)) # Bye bye...\n\n\n# ---- Ordered Categorical Features ----\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n  mutate(OverallQual = factor(OverallQual)) |&gt;\n  mutate(OverallCond = factor(OverallCond))  # Check level orders 1, ..., 10 (BEST)\n\n\n# ---- Binary Features ----\n# Does the installation exist? \n\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n  # CentralAir\n  mutate(CentralAir = if_else(CentralAir == \"N\", \"No\", \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(CentralAir = fct_relevel(CentralAir, \"No\", \"Yes\"))|&gt;\n\n  # NEW IsRemodelled (it will replace YearRemodAdd)\n  mutate(IsRemodelled = if_else(YearRemodAdd - YearBuilt &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(IsRemodelled = factor(IsRemodelled, levels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))) |&gt;\n  select(-YearRemodAdd) |&gt; # Bye YearRemodAdd\n\n  # NEW ExistPool\n  mutate(ExistPool = if_else(PoolArea == 0, \"No\", \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(ExistPool = fct_relevel(ExistPool, \"No\", \"Yes\"))|&gt;\n\n  # NEW ExistGarage\n  mutate(ExistGarage = if_else(GarageArea == 0, \"No\", \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(ExistGarage = fct_relevel(ExistGarage, \"No\", \"Yes\"))|&gt;\n\n  # NEW ExistBsmt\n  mutate(ExistBsmt = if_else(TotalBsmtSF == 0, \"No\", \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(ExistBsmt = fct_relevel(ExistBsmt, \"No\", \"Yes\"))|&gt;\n\n  # NEW Exist2ndFloor\n  mutate(Exist2ndFloor = if_else(`2ndFlrSF` == 0, \"No\", \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n  select(-`2ndFlrSF`) |&gt; # Bye, bye... \n  mutate(Exist2ndFloor = fct_relevel(Exist2ndFloor, \"No\", \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n\n  # NEW ExistFireplace\n  mutate(ExistFireplace = if_else(Fireplaces == 0, \"No\", \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(ExistFireplace = fct_relevel(ExistFireplace, \"No\", \"Yes\"))\n\n\n# ---- The rest are factors ----\n# I'm going to assume that the rest are Categorical variables \n\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), factor))\n\n# ---- Numerical Features ----\n\n# BedroomabvGr (count) left numerical \n# Kitchens (count) left numerical \n# TotRmsAbvGrd (count) left numerical\n# Fireplaces (count) left numerical\n# GarageCars (count) left numerical\n# GarageArea (continous) left numerical \n# MiscVal left numerical \n# MasVnrArea (continous) left numeric\n\n\n# ---- Remove 'LowQualFinSF' ----\n\n# Low quality finished square feet (all floors)\n# Most of the values are 0 -&gt; almost 0 variance. \names_all$LowQualFinSF &lt;- NULL\n```\n\n\nNote that I replaced YearRemodAdd to a simpler binary IsRemodelled variable, similar to what I did with the new GarageNew column.\nOK! Let’s move on.\n\nSearching for simple correlations\nAlthough nothing is linear, is good to have an idea of simple correlations between all variables. After going through the previous steps, it’s obvious that there are correlations. Think about the number of cars that fit in a garage GarageCars and the area of the garage GarageArea.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-num-corr\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 8\n#| fig-cap: Pearson's correlation of numeric features and response.\n#| cap-location: margin\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\names_all |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"train\") |&gt;\n  select(-dataset) |&gt;\n  select(where(is.numeric)) |&gt;  \n  cor(method = \"pearson\") |&gt;\n  corrplot(type = \"lower\", method = \"circle\", insig = 'blank', order = \"hclust\", diag = TRUE,\n  tl.col=\"black\", tl.cex = 0.8, addCoef.col = 'black', number.cex = 0.6)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Pearson’s correlation of numeric features and response.\n\n\n\n\nI’m leaving blank the insignificant correlations for better visualisation and focus. Now I’m checking the categorical variables and the response.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-cat-corr\n#| fig-width: 10\n#| fig-height: 10\n#| fig-cap: Pearson's correlation of categorical features and response.\n#| cap-location: margin\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\names_all |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"train\") |&gt;\n  select(-dataset) |&gt;\n  select(where(is.factor) | contains(\"Price\")) |&gt;  \n  mutate_if(is.factor, as.integer) |&gt; \n  cor(method = \"pearson\") |&gt;\n  corrplot(type = \"lower\", order=\"hclust\", diag = TRUE, insig = 'blank',\n  tl.col=\"black\", tl.cex = 0.8, number.cex = 0.6)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Pearson’s correlation of categorical features and response.\n\n\n\n\nBasically all that has to do with quality ratings is very important for the final sale price.\n\n\nAnalysis of the response variable: Sale Price\nHow well-behaved is the target? Let’s see it:\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-Y\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| column: page-right\n#| fig-width: 6\n#| fig-height: 6\n#| fig-cap: \"Response Analysis.\"\n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"Histogram\"\n#|   - \"Q-Q Plot\"\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\names_all |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"train\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = SalePrice/1000)) +  \n  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = \"seagreen\", fill = \"seagreen\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 800, 50), labels = scales::comma) +  \n  labs(x = \"Sale Price ['000 $]\")\n\names_all |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"train\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(sample = SalePrice/1000)) + \n  stat_qq(color = \"seagreen\", alpha = 0.5) + \n  stat_qq_line(color = \"seagreen\") +  \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 800, 50), labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(y = \"Sale Price\\n['000 $]\",\n       x = \"Theoretical Quantiles (Norm. Dist.)\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Histogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Q-Q Plot\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Response Analysis.\n\n\n\nThe target variable (Y) is clearly not well-bahaved; it shows a log-normal distribution heavily skewed to right. In order to achieve better predictions, a transformation will be needed.\n\nTransformation of the response\nIn my experience, processes that have to do with money, e.g., sale prices, costs of products, salaries, they are most of the time Log-normal. Rarely is something free, so you don’t have zeros; think about the top 1% of reach people, or anything that becomes exotic or premium the higher the ammount of money is involved. These are long and sparsed tails.\nThe moment the first data transformation is performed, we start to loose interpretability very quickly. Nowadays, the most accurate predictions need more than one transformation in order to work best5.5 Tip: Forget about lineaerity and interpretability if you want the most accurate results.\nThe logarithmic transformation works when there are few large values, like in this case, there are only a few expensive hauses. The logarithm scale will shrink that right tail6, making the distribution of the values more normal-like.6 Tip: think of a Logarithmic transformation like pressing an accordeon only from your right arm.\nHowever, because we have a computer and libraries with written functions to perform variable transformations, I will use the Box-Cox transformation, which is a family of transformations (functions) that includes the logarithmic one.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-boxcox\n#| fig-cap: \"Best parameter lambda near 0. Almost a pure logarithmic transformation.\"\n#| column: margin\n#| code-fold: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nboxcox_trans &lt;- MASS::boxcox(lm(SalePrice ~ 1, data = subset(ames_all, dataset == \"train\")), \n                             lambda = seq(-1, 1), \n                             plotit = TRUE)\n\nlambda &lt;- as.numeric(boxcox_trans$x[which.max(boxcox_trans$y)])\n\n# New transformed response variable\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n  mutate(SalePrice_bc = (SalePrice^lambda - 1) / lambda)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Best parameter lambda near 0. Almost a pure logarithmic transformation.\n\n\n\nThe new SalePrice_bc should be better behaved…\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-Y-trans\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| column: page-right\n#| fig-width: 6\n#| fig-height: 6\n#| fig-cap: \"Transformed Response.\"\n#| fig-subcap:\n#|   - \"Histogram\"\n#|   - \"Q-Q Plot\"\n#| layout-ncol: 2\n\names_all |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"train\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = SalePrice_bc)) +  \n  geom_histogram(bins = 50, color = \"seagreen\", fill = \"seagreen\", alpha = 0.5) +  \n  labs(x = \"Sale Price [Box-Cox]\")\n\names_all |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"train\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(sample = SalePrice_bc)) + \n  stat_qq(color = \"seagreen\", alpha = 0.5) + \n  stat_qq_line(color = \"seagreen\") +   \n  labs(y = \"Sale Price\\n[Box-Cox]\", x = \"Theoretical Quantiles (Norm. Dist.)\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Histogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Q-Q Plot\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Transformed Response.\n\n\n\n… and it is, indeed. Well, except for the tails now it’s normal at the core.\nI will include the transformation of the response as a step within a recipe in the modelling phase."

    "text": "Impute Missing Values\nFirst things first, read the full data description2. There you’ll find that for several columns, missing values NA means actually “None”. The physical absence of a determined feature in a house is a category exposing the lack of such quality that can have a significant impact on the response SalePrice. Later it is most probably that binary features indicating the existance of some installations should be created.2 Tip: print a copy, make notes and study it. This is the first step to get into domain knowledge, in this case Real Estate, for later Feature Engineering.\nTherefore, I will fill the empty NA fields of the indicated columns of both datasets with the string “None”.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: easy replace_na\n\ncols_NA_to_none &lt;- list(\n  Alley = \"None\",\n  BsmtQual = \"None\", BsmtCond = \"None\", BsmtExposure = \"None\", BsmtFinType1 = \"None\", BsmtFinType2 = \"None\", \n  FireplaceQu = \"None\", \n  GarageType = \"None\", GarageFinish = \"None\", GarageQual = \"None\", GarageCond = \"None\", \n  PoolQC = \"None\",\n  Fence = \"None\", \n  MiscFeature = \"None\")\n\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n  replace_na(cols_NA_to_none)   \n```\n\n\nOne of the early and recurrent steps of the EDA is to check the completeness of data. Let’s search for missing values, after filling indicated fields3. For this case I wrote the function count_na() that generates the table displayed on the right margin.3 Tip: write a function to quantify missing values depending on the language and labelling system used.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: Counting NAs\n#| code-fold: false\n#| column: margin\n\n# Remaining NA count leaving out target SalePrice\names_all |&gt; \n  select(-SalePrice) |&gt;\n  count_na() |&gt;  \n  knitr::kable(caption = 'Ames dataset')\n```\n\n\n\nAmes dataset\n\n\nVariable\nNA_count\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nLotFrontage\n486\n16.65\n\n\nGarageYrBlt\n159\n5.45\n\n\nMasVnrType\n24\n0.82\n\n\nMasVnrArea\n23\n0.79\n\n\nMSZoning\n4\n0.14\n\n\nUtilities\n2\n0.07\n\n\nBsmtFullBath\n2\n0.07\n\n\nBsmtHalfBath\n2\n0.07\n\n\nFunctional\n2\n0.07\n\n\nExterior1st\n1\n0.03\n\n\nExterior2nd\n1\n0.03\n\n\nBsmtFinSF1\n1\n0.03\n\n\nBsmtFinSF2\n1\n0.03\n\n\nBsmtUnfSF\n1\n0.03\n\n\nTotalBsmtSF\n1\n0.03\n\n\nElectrical\n1\n0.03\n\n\nKitchenQual\n1\n0.03\n\n\nGarageCars\n1\n0.03\n\n\nGarageArea\n1\n0.03\n\n\nSaleType\n1\n0.03\n\n\n\n\nI’ll fill the remaining missing values as follow:\n\nThe LotFrontage column refers to the linear feet of street connected to the house. This feature is not well documented and the missing percentage related to other variables makes it not only unreliable, but very low in variance. Therefore, I will delete the feature.\nEverytime a Garage doesn’t exist, i.e., GarageType = \"None\", there is the corresponding missing value in Garage Year Built GarageYrBlt = NA. I will engineer a new feature called GarageNew with three ordinal categories: None, No, Yes. This based on the delta of YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt; I expect that given the house price, the algorithm will learn that “None” is worse than “No” and so on. Then I will remove the GarageYrBlt predictor.\nFor the rest of variables with a 1 % or less missing values NA, I’ll calculate the median (if numerical) and the mode (if string) in order to fill them with it.\n\nHere’s my pipeline for the whole dataset:\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: terminating NAs\n\n# \"replace_na_with_median\" is a custom function\n\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n  mutate(LotFrontage = NULL) |&gt; # Removing LotFrontage\n  mutate(GarageNew = if_else(YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt; # New Feat.\n  replace_na(list(GarageNew = \"None\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = factor(GarageNew, levels = c(\"None\", \"No\", \"Yes\"))) |&gt; # 3 levels\n  mutate(GarageYrBlt = NULL) |&gt; # Removing old Feat.\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, replace_na_with_median)\n```\n\n\nLet’s get a list with the mode of each remaining columns containing missing values NA.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: Mode for NAs\n\n# Get the mode for reamaining columns with NAs:\n# \"find_mode()\" is a custom function.\n\n# Good, old-fashioned code: apply(ames_all, 2, find_mode)\n\nlist_na_mode &lt;- ames_all |&gt; \n  select(MasVnrType, MasVnrArea, MSZoning, Electrical, Utilities,   BsmtFullBath,   BsmtHalfBath,   Functional, Exterior1st,    Exterior2nd,    BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF,  TotalBsmtSF,    KitchenQual,GarageCars, GarageArea, SaleType) |&gt;\n  map(find_mode)\n\n# map returns a list \n\n# Replace with the created named-lists\names_all &lt;- ames_all |&gt;\n  replace_na(list_na_mode) \n\n# Sanity check of missing values:\nprint(\"Full Ames dataset (train and test)\")\names_all |&gt;\n  select(-SalePrice) |&gt;\n  count_na()\n```\n\n\n[1] \"Full Ames dataset (train and test)\"\n[1] \"No missing values (NA) found.\"\n\n\n“The data is complete!” Let’s think about predictors."
