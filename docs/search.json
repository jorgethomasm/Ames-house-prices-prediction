    "text": "This document demonstrates the use of a number of advanced page layout features to produce an attractive and usable document inspired by the Tufte handout style and the use of Tufte’s styles in RMarkdown documents. The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto1 supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.1 To learn more, you can read more about Quarto or visit Quarto’s Github repository.\n---\ntitle: \"An Example Using the Tufte Style\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n1      margin-width: 350px\n  pdf: default\n2reference-location: margin\ncitation-location: margin\n---\n\n1\n\nIncreases the width of the margin to make more room for sidenotes and margin figures (HTML only).\n\n2\n\nPlaces footnotes and cited sources in the margin. Other layout options (for example placing a figure in the margin) will be set per element in examples below.\n\n\nThese layout features are designed with two important goals in mind:\n\nTo produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same Quarto document;\nTo provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures. If you’d like a figure placed in the margin, just set the option fig-column: margin for your code chunk, and we will take care of the details for you2.\n\n2 You never need to think about \\begin{marginfigure} or &lt;span class=\"marginfigure\"&gt;; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.If you have any feature requests or find bugs in these capabilities, please do not hesitate to file them to https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues."

    "text": "Margin Figures\nImages and graphics play an integral role in Tufte’s work. To place figures in the margin you can use the Quarto chunk option column: margin. For example:\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-margin\n#| fig-cap: \"MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\"\n#| column: margin\n#| message: false\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmtcars2 &lt;- mtcars\nmtcars2$am &lt;- factor(\n  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')\n)\nggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.\n\n\n\nNote the use of the fig-cap chunk option to provide a figure caption. You can adjust the proportions of figures using the fig-width and fig-height chunk options. These are specified in inches, and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin."

    "text": "Full Width Figures\nYou can arrange for figures to span across the entire page by using the chunk option fig-column: page-right.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-fullwidth\n#| fig-cap: \"A full width figure.\"\n#| fig-width: 11\n#| fig-height: 3\n#| fig-column: page-right\n#| warning: false\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +\n  facet_grid(~ cut)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A full width figure.\n\n\n\n\nOther chunk options related to figures can still be used, such as fig-width, fig-cap, and so on. For full width figures, usually fig-width is large and fig-height is small. In the above example, the plot size is \\(11 \\times 3\\)."
