    "text": "This document demonstrates the use of a number of advanced page layout features to produce an attractive and usable document inspired by the Tufte handout style and the use of Tufte’s styles in RMarkdown documents. The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto1 supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.1 To learn more, you can read more about Quarto or visit Quarto’s Github repository.\n---\ntitle: \"An Example Using the Tufte Style\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n1      margin-width: 350px\n  pdf: default\n2reference-location: margin\ncitation-location: margin\n---\n\n1\n\nIncreases the width of the margin to make more room for sidenotes and margin figures (HTML only).\n\n2\n\nPlaces footnotes and cited sources in the margin. Other layout options (for example placing a figure in the margin) will be set per element in examples below.\n\n\nThese layout features are designed with two important goals in mind:\n\nTo produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same Quarto document;\nTo provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures. If you’d like a figure placed in the margin, just set the option fig-column: margin for your code chunk, and we will take care of the details for you2.\n\n2 You never need to think about \\begin{marginfigure} or &lt;span class=\"marginfigure\"&gt;; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.If you have any feature requests or find bugs in these capabilities, please do not hesitate to file them to https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues."

The absence of a determined feature in a house is a category exposing the lack of such quality that can have a significant impact on the Sale Price (response).1 Tip: print a copy, make notes and study it. This is the first step to get into domain knowledge for Feature Engineering in the modelling phase.\nTherefore, I will fill the empty NA fields of the indicated columns of both datasets with the string “None”.\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: easy replace_na\n\ncols_NA_to_none &lt;- list(\n  Alley = \"None\",\n  BsmtQual = \"None\", BsmtCond = \"None\", BsmtExposure = \"None\", BsmtFinType1 = \"None\", BsmtFinType2 = \"None\", \n  FireplaceQu = \"None\", \n  GarageType = \"None\", GarageFinish = \"None\", GarageQual = \"None\", GarageCond = \"None\", \n  PoolQC = \"None\",\n  Fence = \"None\", \n  MiscFeature = \"None\")\n\ndf_all &lt;- df_all |&gt;\n  replace_na(cols_NA_to_none) \n  \ndf_sub &lt;- df_sub |&gt;\n  replace_na(cols_NA_to_none)\n```\n\n\nOne of the early and recurrent steps of the EDA is to check the completeness of data. Therefore, let’s check now, after filling some indicated fields, for missing values2. For this case I wrote the function count_na() that generates the following tables:2 Tip: write a function to quantify missing values depending on the language and labelling system used.\n\nMissing values: training dataset\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: Training NA\ndf_all |&gt; \n  count_na() |&gt;\n  t() |&gt;\n  knitr::kable(caption = 'Training dataset')\n```\n\n\n\nTraining dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLotFrontage\nGarageYrBlt\nMasVnrType\nMasVnrArea\nElectrical\n\n\nCount\n259\n81\n8\n8\n1\n\n\nPercentage\n17.74\n5.55\n0.55\n0.55\n0.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing values: submission dataset\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: Submission NA\ndf_sub |&gt; \n  count_na() |&gt;\n  t() |&gt;\n  knitr::kable(caption = 'Submission dataset') # tbl-cap: Submission Data | tbl-cap-location: margin\n```\n\n\n\nSubmission dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nLotFrontage\nGarageYrBlt\nMasVnrType\nMasVnrArea\nMSZoning\nUtilities\nBsmtFullBath\nBsmtHalfBath\nFunctional\nExterior1st\nExterior2nd\nBsmtFinSF1\nBsmtFinSF2\nBsmtUnfSF\nTotalBsmtSF\nKitchenQual\nGarageCars\nGarageArea\nSaleType\n\n\nCount\n227\n78\n16\n15\n4\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nPercentage\n15.56\n5.35\n1.10\n1.03\n0.27\n0.14\n0.14\n0.14\n0.14\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n0.07\n\n\n\n\n\nI will fill the remaining missing values as follow:\n\nThe LotFrontage column refers to the linear feet of street connected to the house. This feature is not well documented and the missing percentage related to other variables makes it unreliable, therefore, I will delete the feature.\nEverytime there is no garage, i.e., GarageType = \"None\", there is the corresponding missing value in Garage Year Built GarageYrBlt = NA. I will engineer a new feature called GarageNew with three ordinal categories: None, No, Yes. This based on the delta of YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt. Then I will remove the GarageYrBlt predictor.\nFor the rest of variables with a 1 % or less of missing values proportion, I’ll calculate the median (if numerical) and the mode (if categorical) in order to fill them.\n\nHere’s my pipeline for both datasets:\n\n\nCode\n```{r}\n#| label: terminating NAs\n\n# \"replace_na_with_median\" is a custom function\n\ndf_all &lt;- df_all |&gt;\n  mutate(LotFrontage = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = if_else(YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(GarageNew = \"None\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = factor(GarageNew, levels = c(\"None\", \"No\", \"Yes\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageYrBlt = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, replace_na_with_median)\n\n# TODO: Add line with mode for strings....\n\ndf_sub &lt;- df_sub |&gt;\n  mutate(LotFrontage = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = if_else(YearBuilt - GarageYrBlt &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\")) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(GarageNew = \"None\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageNew = factor(GarageNew, levels = c(\"None\", \"No\", \"Yes\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(GarageYrBlt = NULL) |&gt;\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, replace_na_with_median)\n\n# df_sub |&gt; count_na() |&gt; View()\n```"
